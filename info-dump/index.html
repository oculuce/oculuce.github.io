                    <p>Temp typings yay -&gt;</p>
                    <p>ok sc-4v(essie) is weird robot that hoards things. menace to local building of "AIEE". </p>
                    <p>zylvezter is a cordysect wasp who likes testing the limits of his fungal vitality. Full of fungus, but like, in a healthy way. 🏳️‍🌈 with Essie, as her head is convex compared to Essie being concave.</p>
                    <p>Ieda is also a weird robot who is Essies sister... according to her at least. She sows fast-growing plants that sometimes explode. </p>
                    <p>Avo is a singular(!!) red fiendthing that was found and now lives inside Ieda. As a result, her possessions, wellbeing and pronouns are shared with Ieda. Has experienced several crash-courses in robot repair due to many instances of "a really good idea just trust me".</p>
                    <p>80-Z0 is... not dead, but currently out of power. Their body was previously infested by a virus, who got the body hijacked by someone else, and eventually got 'ploded and landed in a scrap heap, with the virus and hijacker running off and deciding to work to cover eachothers weaknesses. Currently, 80-Z0's body is infested by a needly mass with beady green lights, who meets with Essie regularly to talk about scrap.</p>
                    <p>AIEE is a building that is kinda really alive, breathing and shifting and growing and whatnot. Many mannequinthings operate as generic 'workers', though some have ended up being strange regardless (manne-ger manne-gineer manne-virus(rivalry with annie-virus)). I like not using pronouns when referring to AIEE.</p>
                    <p>MOOK(Henry?) is experiencing a persistent issue where a weird green thing comes into her workplace and steals anything not nailed down. She would probably be like an evil The Killer if every drop of hate wasn't already being channelled against Essie.</p>
                    <p>COOK is fantastic at cooking... in video-games. Alas, all Cooking Mama Arcade Machine instances have so far been destroyed, leaving COOK with a... tentative knowledge on food safety, but a healthy appetite for learning new recipes.</p>
                    <p>Acaud is a hive of fiendthings who use various metal objects for offense and skeletal support. Bit of a menace, but her concept of consequences keeps her out of as much (visible) trouble as SC-4V does. <sub>Maybe if Essie didn't already hate MOOK, she could call Acaud out for using her as a scapegoat...</sub> 🏳️‍🌈 with COOK.</p>
                    <p>LOOK looooooooves observing, and is very loose about anything they learn. They never share info first, so it's up to... whoever to ask for what they need.</p>
                    <p>HOOK is missing. Something about going into the sea and gathering a navy for... something. Ambulatory sou'westers and raincoats sighted near bodies of water.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Lucelets are weird things that represent the artist, I think. Almost always some shade of Teal.</p>
                    <p>(Luce) Tawfin is a warped fungus thing growing around a self-gathered prismarine shell. The prismarine is an excuse for me to exclusively play as Merling, but it's also because a material that requires water to properly function is just fascinating to Luce "Literally born in Minecraft Hell" Tawfin. One version of Tawfin experienced a bit of &gt;·&lpar; when a flesh chunk was arguing with her basemates outside her front door claiming to be "the embodiment of the nether". Thats My Brand</p>
                    <p>Fernie Anne is a detective(????) who likes the idea of being sneaky and silently resolving issues, but their general propensity to Being On Fire Constantly simultaneously makes sneaking difficult and inflicting burns much easier. She has a Gun&#8482;, but it's more of a melted gun-shaped club.</p>
                    <p>Olchys Flurrie Beaumawn is a big fan of scaring the living daylights out of people by pretending to be a ghost sheriff. At night, she is forced to actually do their job due to being Solid Ice and not Water Vapour. <br>Almost certainly chose his own name.</p>
                    <p>Hauuum is decomposing in cancelled-dnd-session world. Maybe one day they'll escape.</p>
                    <p>Guy has a staff on the left leg that constantly fires a death ray upwards.</p>
