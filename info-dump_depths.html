            <article>
                <p>Mechanical humanoids capable of a great many things, depending on what body parts they're wearing.
                Mechae are most commonly seen near the towns and outposts they carve out for themselves, though it isn't uncommon to see one out in the wilderness or within other civilizations.
                </p>
                <div class="hide">
                    <p>Home-bound workers have easy access to charge stations, while those needing to do extended remote work must
                        install portable generators inside themselves, either powered by concentrated <strong>Juice</strong> or more mundane fuels.
                        <br>While certain parts can be common between mechae, it's rare to see one mechae who looks identical to another.</p>
                        <p>Mechae are formed when the proper components are within a <strong>Juice</strong>-saturated environment, such as within a scrapyard, spontaneously forming a conscious core.
                            Most quickly die when the surrounding soul energy flows elsewhere, but rarely,
                            one of these cores will be formed pre-attached to functional limbs, allowing it to cobble together a body capable of functioning without being immersed in a <strong>Juice</strong>-rich environment.
                            <br>Most mechae, however, are created when a full body with the parts needed to form a core are placed in the appropriate environment, waking up with everything they need to
                            function normally. This is usually done by other people who are in need of more bodies, and can't be bothered with finding someone to hire.
                        </p>
                        <p>Most people avoid keeping spare parts near eachother for extended periods of time, as it is not impossible to come back home to a
                            newly born mechae trying to break out of your house.
                        </p>
                        <p>Due to cores being formed from soul, each one comes with its own blend of mannerisms, affected by the experiences of whoever was within the <strong>Juice</strong> that awakened them.</p>

            <p>A group of bugs who've introduced a funny fungus into themselves. They're not dead- some people claim they're more alive than anyone else-
                but their jerky movement and the occasional rotting bodypart gives those unused to them some pause.
                <br>They're generally friendly to strangers, though the reputations of outsiders spread quickly between their colonies.
                <p>Cordysects aren't too durable, but are capable of quickly recovering from injuries that would be fatal without their fungal attributes.
                    Injuries still wear down on them over time, and routine mendings will eventually lead them to become more fungus than bug.
                    Overgrown cordysects aren't terribly mobile, but are more adept at managing fungal connections.

                Generally a menace, but appreciated in cordysectic colonies for the large corpses she drags in. She can siphon the volatile fuel from her internal reserves for use in exploding things.

                Capable of growing extra 'limbs' for use in grappling or grabbing things, though she needs to cool down after any particularly demanding stunts. The caustic acid they produce is used by Ieda for her various experiments.

            <p>Robotic creature that works for AIEE. A MOOK is created either by AIEE or by. Dude im literally sick i dont have the brain power
                lllisten here its a suited robot that works for a faceless* building that doesnt caare about anything but Making Things as far as MOOK cares,
                running halfway across the world to research fungi counts as serving AIEE as long as it comes back with like a fungus.
                you should avoid any MOOK you see- their self-assigned tasks can range from gathering pebbles to stealing resources to creating more MOOKs by "recycling" other robots.
                <br>imagine a MOOK getting into a fight with another MOOK because M1 is trying to keep M2 from breaking the person they're documenting in half
            </p>
            <p>MOOK is the top contributor to Cave Wikipedia&reg;. Many people find it disconcerting that their whole life history is publicly available.
