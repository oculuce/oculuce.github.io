                    <p>Hi. Isolated images are anything I like enough to isolate, but the doodleboards section has basically 99% of every digital thing I've ever drawn.</p>
                    <p>Click the images to open them in full quality. The earlier ones are... excessively upscaled but the newer ones are exact pixel size with a filter so its not Super Blurry.</p>
                    <p>Tall images get a scrollbar, but you can always open the image in your browser to see what it looks like in full.</p>

                    <p>You're gonna have to open these ones and zoom in.</p>
                    <p>I draw 99% of my digital art on these. Lets me immediately doodle something else if I get bored of drawing a thing, or adding onto an image thats weeks old.</p>
                    <p>
                        Each doodleboard has a different completion time, since it's just when theres not enough space for me to draw comfortably.
                        <br>Theres dates if past-me remembered to write them down, as well as certain tells (the spamton segments in #3 and #4 are bc of spamtober, for example).
