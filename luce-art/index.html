                <p>You're gonna have to open these ones and zoom in.</p>
                <p>I draw 99% of my digital art on these. Lets me immediately doodle something else if I get bored of drawing a thing, or adding onto an image thats weeks old.</p>
                <p>
                    Each doodleboard has a different completion time, since it's just when theres not enough space for me to draw comfortably.
                    <br>Theres dates if past-me remembered to write them down, as well as certain tells (the spamton segments in #3 and #4 are bc of spamtober, for example).
