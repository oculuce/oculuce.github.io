It's like that but you go through an aliens diary. and theres alive things in the diary nibbling at the pages. *voice of someone who wants you to click the link* Click the link</p>

                    <p>This is a One Action Every Ten Minutes game. This is a reading game where cool things happen. Use all the codes to get the action boosters and then never ever use them.</p>
                    <p>If you can get past the action economy, and are like 15-25% spreadsheet pervert and a lore fan, this is a pretty good game. Also it took me a year to get near (what was) endgame so...</p>

                    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427410/Abiotic_Factor/">Abiotic Factor</a>
                    <p>Abiotic Factor. It's like a survival game in Half Life, which means I am a big fan of it instead of falling off like other survival games that are just Mine Redium Ore to make Redium Pick to mine Greenium Ore to make Greenium Pick. I'm seeing people talking about having to grind for hours just to progress in the new update and IDK maybe me running from evil enemies is saving me hours of grinding for... something?? I want to watch their playthroughs and see what they're doing so horribly wrong.</p>

                    <a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/ghosttrick/en-us/">Ghost Trick</a>
                    <p>Play Ghost Trick. It's a game about mysteries so spoilers are like, you know, Spoilers! Like 'jimbob MURDERS glumbo in chapter 50 but it was because glumbo was secretly gloogy, but greg doesn't know that so he KILLS jimbob' tier spoilers</p>

                    <p>Modded minecraft... Modded Minecraft...</p>
                    <p>Botania: I like thinking about it. Always make thrice the ingredients you need or suffer. The right-click-with-empty-hand feature is wonderful QOL.</p>
                    <p>Blood Magic is also fun to, uh, think about. I love love loooooooove intersecting the ritual stones with eachother- skeletal structures that you can decorate yourself is yummier than Get 50 Planks For My Structure. Put a hopper under your blood altar and filter it vanillastyle.</p>
                    <p>Chromaticraft is fun. Read the manual.</p>
                    <p>Create is fun. Sometimes I see someone who hates Create so bad and I want to see their full experience with the mod...</p>
                    <p>Thaumcraft !!! !!!! !!!!! Really yummerly mod with a vast quantity of addons. Thaumic Horizons. Thaumic Horizons. Thaumcraft 7 is in development BTW</p>

                    <p>Outer Wilds is a game about solving puzzles (in an Earlygame Baba Is You, not Lategame Baba Is You way) and discovering things, so spoilers are also bad for it. I played this game at 2-13 FPS on my pooplaptop and I still loved it.</p>
