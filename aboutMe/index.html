                    <p>awesome web game. i opened it after having saved the link for like 2 week and then i played all
                        of it
                        from start to current content at that time (ep2). I don't even know why I found this game. I
                        just
                        randomly decided to open the stream suggestions channel in hollow_tones server once, found this
                        and
                        then never opened that channel again.</p>
                    <div class="hide">
                        <p>it has influenced me drastically. definitely in, uh, less Normal ways (it gave me a really
                            useful format to run thoughts
                            through that happens to involve a lot of me saying "we" to myself.
                            imagine me throttling myself in order to cut off an intrusive thought, it not
                            helping, and then me telling myself the definintion of an intrusive thought. surprisingly
                            just going 'Trying not to think about an intrusive thought doesnt work because I end up just
                            thinking about avoiding the intrusive thought. Like the Discordance from Fallen London,
                            except not at all.' works wonders. this parentheses is going on for a while huh. all the
                            images in my head can be terminated by having them remove their face like a mask and
                            revealing a Me underneath, is what I'm trying to get at).</p>

                    <p>Numbers game and story game about a city what fell downwards. The buy-more-actions thing is so
                        worthless it basically doesn't exist.</p>
                    <p>Total of just under 11 months of expending as many actions as reasonable and I haven't gotten
                        everything. If you're already playing a bozo timesink sim you might as well swap to this one.
                        C'mon. We have skeletons and corporate debt. Put away that gacha game and play this.</p>
                    <p>This is that game that has a road filled with 'dont fuuuuuuuucking do this' signs that leads to
                        your character being destroyed. You only have to be worried about this if you can't resist
                        clicking evil buttons that hurt you.</p>

                        <p>fuuuuck i open fallen london im like "yeah ok whatever" and im just realizing im hooked onto
                            this
                            game several weekly rewards later. uh, it has an energy system and stuff locked behind a
                            paywall. some of the paid stuff is Neat Sidecontent (presumable IDK havent bought it) and
                            then
                            you also
                            have the generic pay-for-more-actions stuff. Don't buy actions. if you can get through the
                            initial grind, you'll be met with more grind AND neat writing. yeah dont play this game if
                            you
                            hate grind. do play this game if you want to read cool words. or if you like making your
                            character stare at bones all day every day to get enough money to afford their horrible,
                            horrible laudanum addiction.
                            <br> i opened up ff14 again after some months and im realizing. if you loooveee pressing

                            also for you. crafting 500 copper bars gives me no real ingame benefit but i love pushing
                            those
                            buttons- oh this is the Fallen London section, copper? I mean Bessemer Steel Ingots. fallen

                <p>One of those games where the mods are quality enough that you're missing out without them. But, still
                    playable on its own! This game is addictive. I love it. You don't have to commit war crimes on
                    purpose in this game. (...putting raiders in blood chambers to produce blood for my vampires isn't
                    war crimes...) I'm still on my first colony as of typing this. They keep slapping the shit out of
                    eachother. Most of my blood use is making my vampires use their blood magic to heal eachother when
                    they decide to just fight eachother. Game good.</p>

                    like axes being thrown at you. What I just typed was nothing. Part of the game is learning how to

                    haven't seen any toxic people... yet, so it's been fun. big bonus points I didn't notice for a bit
                    is that I haven't even seen any microtransactions yet!
                    no Spend Bobux for Skin or Look at this Popup to Buy my XP Boost or anything overly whaley as far as

                <p>Thaumcraft. Thaumcraft seven. Look at me.</p>
                <p>Thaumcraft 7 is a mod being made by the CoFH team as an official continuation of Azanors thaumcraft
                    1-6.</p>
                <p>There are several sneak peeks and videos, with screenshots being posted every few weeks in the CoFH
                    discord. Wands. Thaumonomicon. New research system.</p>

                <h3>Twitch (various)</h3>
                <p>im not. making a category for each streamer i watch. anyways. <a href="https://tomatotruth.com/"
                        alt="the dark truth behind twitch streamer Tomato Gaming">tomato</a> and <a
                        href="https://www.twitch.tv/socksbx">socksbx</a> and <a
                        href="https://www.twitch.tv/hollow_tones">hollow_tones</a>. go watch them.</p>
                <p>the red one has the streamer, chat and mods all being the heel, sometimes at the exact same time. its
                    fun. the hatted one is. how do I describe this. pervert streamer, but like on the wavelength of
                    "puzzle pervert" not the other one if that makes sense. except during the mediashare streams
                    somethings tainted about 25% of the streamtime during those. the bibi one is yay. theres a cool
                    streamer there. I shgould be doing that thing due tomorrow</p>

                <p>really good game. doing a fist only run has rendered me unable to use weapons. if someone tells you
                    that you need to learn how to "triple gunkboost" or that you're playing like this one person they
                    don't like, you don't have to listen to them.</p>

                    accidentally going against them). not that active but I do want to get around to (re)playing it
                    more.
                    If you ever get someone to play ff14? Just a heads up. Don't poke at every bad thing in ARR?
                    Seriously!! Stop poisoning the well!! This is why I stopped playing on my first account. It felt
                    like I being told I wasn't supposed to enjoy anything about the game I was playing until 'the good
                    part'. <sub>reminds me of 'skip to act 5'...</sub>

                <h3>Cookie Run: Ovenbreak</h3>
                <p>they used to do events where you played a bit and then got a maxed-out good character. thats why I
                    had a maxed-out lemon cookie, dj cookie, and whipped cream cookie. they literally annihilated skater
                    cookie off of the face of the earth for no reason. oh yeah and all the microtransactions sucked too.
                    you know what this game has done for me though? Its given me a reason to never play a gacha again
                    (like i got poked to play genshin one time and. the rates man... what was it like 0.5% chance to
                    pull like a 5 star)</p>

                    think I even knew it was a webcomic I could read for a hot minute. regardless if you ever want to
                    read homestuck, USE THE UNOFFICIAL COLLECTION! It, uh, actually functions (thanks bambosh(distinct lack of thanks to
                    Viz Media)). Anyways homestuck is a webcomic that has really high highs and really, awfully low
                    lows. Its fine.</p>
